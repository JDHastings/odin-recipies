		<img src="../images/crawfish.jpg" alt="Crawfish Etouffee" class="center">
		<h1>Description</h1>
		<p>This traditional Cajun stew gets its flavor from what is known as the Trinity-onion, green bell pepper, and celery-and<br>
		the rich spices used to create Cajun seasoning. It's similar to gumbo but with a thicker gravy-type base. Serve over<br>
		rice to make a complete meal.</p>
		<h1>Ingredients</h1>
		<ul>
			<li>5 tablespoons butter</li>
			<li>5 tablespoons all-purpose flour</li>
			<li>1 yellow onion, chopped</li>
			<li>1 green bell pepper, chopped</li>
			<li>2 stalks celery, chopped</li>
			<li>4 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
			<li>2 tablespoons Cajun seasoning, divided, or to taste</li>
			<li>1 teaspoon cayenne pepper (optional)</li>
			<li>2 cups fish stock</li>
			<li>Salt and ground black pepper to taste</li>
			<li>1 pound cooked crawfish tail meat</li>
		</ul>
		<h1>Directions</h1>
		<ol>
			<li>Melt butter in a Dutch over over medium heat. Stir in flour to make the roux, and stir continuously until<br>
				roux is at least the color of peanut butter, about 10 minutes, or for a darker roux, 15 to 20 minutes.</li>
			<li>Add onions, bell pepper, celery, and garlic; cook and stir for 5 to 7 minutes. Stir in half the Cajun<br>
				seasoning, cayenne pepper, and stock. Season with salt and ground black pepper. Reduce heat to low and<br>
				simmer for 15 minutes.</li>
			<li>Stir in crawfish, turn heat off, and cover. Let stand until crawfish are heated through. Taste and add<br>
				remaining half of Cajun seasoning, if needed.</li>
		</ol>
